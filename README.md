# Uncommon HTML Bug: &lt;object&gt; Tag with Incorrect File Path

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the &lt;object&gt; tag in HTML.  The bug arises from providing an incorrect or inaccessible file path in the `data` attribute, leading to unexpected behavior and a lack of clear error indication to the user.

## Bug Description
The &lt;object&gt; tag is used to embed external content, such as multimedia files.  However, if the specified file path is incorrect, the content won't load.  The fallback content (usually a paragraph) may appear, but doesn't inform the user of the reason for the failure. This makes debugging difficult for users unfamiliar with the &lt;object&gt; tag.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves robust error handling and more informative feedback to the user.  This can be achieved by:
1.  Ensuring the file path is correct and accessible.
2.  Implementing JavaScript to check for errors during object loading.
3.  Providing a more informative error message to the user if the object fails to load.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.  You'll see that the embedded object fails to load due to the invalid file path. Note the fallback content is generic.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to view the corrected version with more informative error handling.
